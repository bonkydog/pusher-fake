A fake [Pusher](http://pusher.com) server for development and testing.

## Usage

#### 1. Use the PusherFake JS for the Pusher JS instance.

```erb
<script>
  <%== PusherFake.javascript if defined?(PusherFake) %>
</script>
```

#### 2. Start PusherFake in Cucumber environment. If you aren't using Cucumber, see [pusher-fake/cucumber.rb](https://github.com/tristandunn/pusher-fake/blob/master/lib/pusher-fake/cucumber.rb).

```ruby
require "pusher-fake/cucumber"
```

## Examples

* [pusher-fake-example](https://github.com/tristandunn/pusher-fake-example) - An example of using pusher-fake with Cucumber to test a Rails application.

## Goal

Fully recreate the Pusher API service for development and testing.

#### Why?

* Using a remote API for testing is slow.
* Working offline is currently impossible.
* Wasting connections and messages in development is unreasonable.
* Stubbing the JavaScript, such as with [pusher-test-stub](https://github.com/leggetter/pusher-test-stub), is suboptimal and tedious for integration tests.
